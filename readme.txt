Author Box Plus allows blog owners to manage authors and their profiles.

== Description ==

Author Box Plus is a lot more than just an Author box. If you have a blog and are dealing with multiple authors on your blog, this plugin will add some exciting features for you.
It will let you enable or disable an author from putting a link back on their names. The admin will be able to enable a link to the authors so they can have their own page on your domain (http://yourdomain.com/author/user-name).

When you enable the link for the authors, it will be linked to their personal author page like above. Authors can then design their own page with the default template and have their Bio, social media profiles and recent posts displayed on this page.
This will be in addition to the author box which displays underneath each post.

Features:

* Displays Author’s Bio along with social icons, linked to authors social accounts at the end of every post.
* Author’s Profile Page: Complete detailed profile page, with profile picture, author bio, author recent blog posts, author social profile details.
* Administrator can decide which author’s profile page should be visible to visitors.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Manage through Dashboard => Users => Authors

== Screenshots ==
